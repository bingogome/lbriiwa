## 1. Description

This package handles the different files for bringing up the robot and showing it in Rviz. 

## 2. Requirements
The following packages needs to be installed:
- joint_state_publisher
- robot_state_publisher


## 3. Run

To visualize the URDF model of the robot in Rviz, you need two terminals and run the following commands:

```
$ ros2 launch lbr_bringup rviz.launch.py
```
```
$ ros2 launch lbr_bringup state_publisher.launch.py
```
```
$ ros2 run lbr_bringup dummy_joint_states
```

The latter will run a dummy joint state publisher which publishes fake data for the joints which are not fixed. This is necessary to properly visualize the manipulator.
